# TO DO ...
# Create a class named Bookmark with the following:
#   An initializer that accepts url and title parameters:
#     it should set instance variables named url, title
#     it should set a read only variable named last_visited
#   A method named visit! which sets last_visited to the current time and date (hint: the Time.now method returns an instance of Time)
